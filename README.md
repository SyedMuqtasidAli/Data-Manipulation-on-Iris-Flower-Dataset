## 📋 Introduction
This project demonstrates basic data manipulation and analysis techniques using the Pandas library. The Iris dataset is used as an example to showcase various data manipulation tasks such as loading data, cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis, and visualizing data.

## ✨ Features
- 📂 Loads the Iris dataset using Pandas.
- 🧹 Performs basic data cleaning and preprocessing.
- 🔍 Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.
- 📊 Visualizes data using matplotlib and seaborn.

## 🛠️ Installation
To get started with the Basic Data Manipulation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-data-manipulation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd basic-data-manipulation
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage
To use the Basic Data Manipulation notebook, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see Installation section).

2. Place the `Iris.csv` file in the project directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
